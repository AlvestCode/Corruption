# Corruption
In this repositorry I will cover the entire process of creating a database using SQL, from the establishment of the elements and its relationships to some example queries.

In this repository you will find:
- sql file 
- Two drawio files with the diagrams of the database 
- Two csv files with data to upload into the database
